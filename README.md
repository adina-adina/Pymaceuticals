I used ChatGPT to help me with the code.  I also used it to help me edit the written summary.  I wrote it on my own first.  So the actual analysis is entirely my own.
However, ChatGPT gave me helpful stylistic suggestions.  And this was the first time I experimented with a chatbot for writing advice.  I now see the power and utility
in using it for professional writing support.
